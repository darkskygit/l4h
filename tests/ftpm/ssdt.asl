/*
 * tests/run-attesttest.sh: the ACPI side of an AMD-style fTPM over QEMU's
 * tpm-crb.  Its start method (TPM2 table: 2, ACPI start) has the OS call
 * _DSM function 1 for every command; here, as the PSP's firmware would,
 * that is what makes the command run: it takes locality 0, sets the CRB
 * start bit, waits for the command to finish and gives the locality
 * back.  QEMU ignores the start bit without a locality, and the OS takes
 * none with this start method, so the start bit the OS sets too does
 * nothing, as with an fTPM, whose CRB registers are plain memory.  Each
 * start also writes 'S' to the isa-debugcon port, for the test to count.
